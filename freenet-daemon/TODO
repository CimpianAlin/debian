- use service-wrapper-java for the freenet-daemon service
- but have a /usr/bin/freenet so users can run freenet "directly" from the jar

- split freenet-ext up better
  - probably put the bundled libs in /usr/share/java/freenet rather than /usr/share/java
  - package the external libs properly so that we can get rid of the ant-contrib dependency
  - split arch-dependent JNI libs out of JAR files

/var/run/freenet maybe needs to be moved.
program directories need to be put in a new section in the freenet config.
