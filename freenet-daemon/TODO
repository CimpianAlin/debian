- freenet is still under development so it is VITAL that
  we get start-stop-daemon to log the stdout/stderr of java.

- split freenet-ext up better
  - package the external libs properly so that we can get rid of the ant-contrib dependency
  - split arch-dependent JNI libs out of JAR files

/var/run/freenet maybe needs to be moved.
program directories need to be put in a new section in the freenet config.
