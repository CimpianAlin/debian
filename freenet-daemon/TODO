- freenet is still under development so it is VITAL that
  we get start-stop-daemon to log the stdout/stderr of java.

- build freenet-ext properly; atm it just downloads it

- split freenet-ext up properly
  - first thing is to split arch-dependent JNI libs out of the jar

/var/run/freenet maybe needs to be moved.
program directories need to be put in a new section in the freenet config.
