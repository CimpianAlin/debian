- have a /usr/bin/freenet so users can run freenet "directly" from the jar
- use debuild to build source packages rather than our own custom code
- currently, tests are run twice
- split arch-dependent JNI libs out of JAR files

- /var/run/freenet maybe needs to be moved.
- package the external libs properly so that we can get rid of the ant-contrib dependency

- fred: program directories need to be put in a new section in the freenet config.
- split wrapper.conf up
