Freenet for Debian/Ubuntu
-------------------------------

This repository contains files needed to build .deb packages for Freenet. This
is still in an early development stage - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

In particular, the directory structure has not yet been finalised, and may be
changed in future revisions. To keep things simple, for now we make no effort
to do automatic file migrations, which means your node may lose its settings
and user data after an upgrade.

See README.update for the information on the latest state of the package.


o How to build freenet-daemon(fred)

Run the build script, `./build-freenet-daemon`. Built packages will be put into
this directory.

You might need to install some dependencies for the build to succeed. Check the
Build-Depends line in debian/control, or follow the error messages.

Some of the build-dependencies (e.g. at the time of writing, service-wrapper)
are only available in newer suites of Debian, such as experimental. To install
these using aptitude (which will pull in their dependencies as well), add the
suite to your /etc/apt/sources.list, then run

$ aptitude -t <suite name> install service-wrapper

You probably first want to add the following to your /etc/apt/apt.conf:

APT::Default-Release "<your default suite, e.g testing>";

to prevent aptitude from upgrading all your other packages to the newer suite.
