Freenet for Debian/Ubuntu
-------------------------------

This repository contains files needed to build .deb packages for Freenet.

o How to build freenet-daemon(fred)

First, you need to clone fred-staging and contrib-staging from
Freenet GitHub repos. 

FIXME hack
Checkout the "dir-struct" branch from fred-staging. This uses a directory
structure which fits the FHS much better, instead of shoving everything in
/var/lib/freenet.

Then put things in a directory as following:

.
|-- 00update-fred.sh
|-- contrib-official -> contrib-staging
|-- debian
`-- fred-official -> contrib-staging

Now you can run the build script, 00update-fred.sh.  You might need to install needed Build-Dep packages.  Check the Build-Depends line in debian/control or follow error messages.  Built packages will be put into a directory called freenet-daemon-official-dist.
