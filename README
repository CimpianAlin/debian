Freenet for Debian/Ubuntu
-------------------------------

This repository contains files needed to build .deb packages for Freenet. This
is still in an early development stage - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

In particular, the directory structure has not yet been finalised, and may be
changed in future revisions. To keep things simple, for now we make no effort
to do automatic file migrations, which means your node may lose its settings
and user data after an upgrade.

So, either use this package as a test node ONLY, or follow the changes on git
so you can move your data appropriately before an upgrade.

o How to build freenet-daemon(fred)

First, you need to clone fred-staging and contrib-staging from
Freenet GitHub repos. 

(FIXME hack) Then, checkout the "dir-struct" branch from fred-staging. This
uses a directory structure which fits the FHS better, instead of shoving
everything in /var/lib/freenet.

Then put things in a directory as following:

.
|-- 00update-fred.sh
|-- contrib-staging
|-- debian
`-- contrib-staging

Now you can run the build script, `./00update-fred.sh staging`.

You might need to install needed Build-Dep packages.  Check the Build-Depends line in debian/control or follow error messages.  Built packages will be put into a directory called freenet-daemon-official-dist.
